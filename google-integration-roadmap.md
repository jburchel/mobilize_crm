# Google Integration Roadmap for Mobilize CRM

## Overview

This document outlines the steps needed to integrate Google Calendar with the Tasks feature and Gmail with the Communications feature in your Mobilize CRM app for Crossover Global.

## 1. Prerequisites and Setup

### Google Cloud Project Configuration
- [x] Create a Google Cloud Project in the Google Cloud Console
- [x] Enable the Google Calendar API and Gmail API
- [x] Configure OAuth consent screen
  - Set app name, user support email, and developer contact information
  - Add scopes for Calendar and Gmail APIs
- [x] Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
  - Generate client ID and client secret
  - Set authorized redirect URIs for your application

### Authentication Flow
- [x] Implement Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flow in your application
- [x] Store access tokens securely with appropriate refresh mechanisms
- [x] Add a new section in user settings for Google integration permissions

## 2. Google Calendar Integration with Tasks

### Backend Development
- [x] Create a new blueprint/module for calendar integration
- [x] Implement token handling and API client initialization
- [x] Develop functions to:
  - [x] Create calendar events from tasks
  - [x] Update calendar events when tasks change
  - [x] Retrieve events and sync with tasks
  - [x] Handle recurring tasks/events
  - [x] Manage calendar event notifications and reminders

### Database Updates
- [x] Add fields to the Task model:
  - [x] `google_calendar_event_id` - Store Google Calendar event IDs
  - [x] `google_calendar_sync_enabled` - Boolean flag for sync status
  - [x] `last_synced_at` - Timestamp for tracking sync status

### Frontend Development
- [x] Update Tasks UI to display calendar integration status
- [x] Add calendar view option in the Tasks interface
- [x] Create toggle controls for enabling/disabling calendar sync per task
- [x] Implement a calendar widget showing upcoming events/tasks
- [x] Add user preferences for default calendar sync settings

### Synchronization Logic
- [x] Implement bi-directional sync between tasks and calendar events
- [ ] Create background job for periodic synchronization
- [ ] Add conflict resolution strategy for conflicting updates
- [x] Implement proper error handling and user notifications

## 3. Gmail Integration with Communications

### Backend Development
- [ ] Create a new blueprint/module for Gmail integration
- [ ] Implement token handling and API client initialization
- [ ] Develop functions to:
  - [ ] Send emails through Gmail API
  - [ ] Retrieve and store relevant emails
  - [ ] Attach emails to appropriate person/church records
  - [ ] Parse email threads and conversations

### Database Updates
- [ ] Add fields to the Communication model:
  - [ ] `gmail_message_id` - Store Gmail message IDs
  - [ ] `gmail_thread_id` - Store Gmail thread IDs
  - [ ] `email_status` - Track email delivery status
  - [ ] `attachments` - Store information about email attachments

### Frontend Development
- [ ] Enhance the communications interface to support email composition
- [ ] Add email templates functionality
- [ ] Implement email history view for person/church records
- [ ] Create controls for email attachments
- [ ] Add email tracking and notification features

### Integration Features
- [ ] Implement email threading and conversation tracking
- [ ] Create automated email logging to communications history
- [ ] Add capability to schedule emails for future delivery
- [ ] Develop email templates for common communications

## 4. Testing and Validation

### Calendar Integration Testing
- [ ] Test task creation → calendar event creation
- [ ] Test task updates → calendar event updates
- [ ] Test calendar event creation → task creation (if implementing this direction)
- [ ] Validate reminders and notifications
- [ ] Test handling of recurring events

### Email Integration Testing
- [ ] Test email sending through Gmail API
- [ ] Test email logging and attachment handling
- [ ] Validate email threading and conversation tracking
- [ ] Test email templates and scheduling features

### Security and Performance Testing
- [ ] Audit token storage and handling
- [ ] Test token refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Validate proper permission scopes are used
- [ ] Performance test with bulk operations
- [ ] Test synchronization with poor connectivity

## 5. Deployment and Monitoring

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Update database schema in production
- [ ] Deploy new code with feature flags
- [ ] Configure monitoring for API usage and rate limits
- [ ] Set up error alerting for integration failures

### User Rollout
- [ ] Create user documentation for Google integrations
- [ ] Implement a guided setup flow for users
- [ ] Develop training materials for team members
- [ ] Plan phased rollout to test with subset of users first

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] Set up logging for Google API interactions
- [ ] Implement monitoring for API quota usage
- [ ] Create dashboard for sync status and failures
- [ ] Plan for handling API changes and deprecations

## 6. Future Enhancements

### Potential Extensions
- [ ] Google Drive integration for document storage
- [ ] Google Meet integration for scheduling meetings
- [ ] Google Sheets integration for reporting
- [ ] Mobile push notifications for calendar events
- [ ] Email campaign tracking and analytics

## Technical Considerations

### API Rate Limits
- Be aware of Google API quotas and implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Consider batch operations for efficiency where possible

### Authentication Best Practices
- Use refresh tokens appropriately
- Implement token rotation for security
- Store tokens securely (consider encryption at rest)

### Error Handling
- Plan for API availability issues
- Implement graceful degradation when Google services are unavailable
- Provide clear user feedback for integration issues
